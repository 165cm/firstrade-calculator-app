## Password Configuration

To set up the export password configuration:

1. Copy the sample configuration file:
```bash
cp src/config/exportConfig.sample.ts src/config/exportConfig.ts
```

2. Edit `src/config/exportConfig.ts` and replace the sample passwords with your actual monthly passwords.

> Note: `exportConfig.ts` is ignored by git for security reasons. Make sure to keep your passwords secure and never commit them to the repository.
